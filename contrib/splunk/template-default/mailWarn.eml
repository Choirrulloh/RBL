Hi,
  I'm sorry to let you know that <{emailListed}> has added to our blocklist for {expInterval}.
This is the reason:


{reason}



We assume that the account is compromised.
A very common reason for the emission of spam is the existence of passwords that are known to spammers, either by guessing, phishing or malware spying.

Please check your mailserver reputation and stop the outbound spam. Common measures are:
- Check for and reject weak passwords.
- Change the password of compromised accounts.
- Rate limit authentication attempts to prevent password cracking.
- Users should NEVER follow links or fill out forms found in such an email message.

If you don't stop the outbreak the address could be relisted in future.

Best Regards.
